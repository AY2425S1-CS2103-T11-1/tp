  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

# **FAQ**

## **Q1: How can I easily find the correct Product IDs when adding orders?**
**A:** When adding orders, you can use these tips to find the correct Product IDs:

For Customer Orders:
1. First run `viewPastryCatalogue` to see all available pastries and their IDs
2. Keep the catalogue visible while typing your `addCustomerOrder` command
3. Reference the IDs from the catalogue for the `o/PASTRYID` parameter
4. Example workflow:
   ```
   > viewPastryCatalogue
   [catalogue appears showing pastries and their IDs]
   > addCustomerOrder n/John p/98765432 o/1 2 3
   ```

For Supply Orders:
1. First run `viewIngredientCatalogue` to see all ingredients and their IDs
2. Keep the catalogue visible while typing your `addSupplyOrder` command
3. Reference the IDs from the catalogue for the `o/INGREDIENTID` parameter
4. Example workflow:
   ```
   > viewIngredientCatalogue
   [catalogue appears showing ingredients and their IDs]
   > addSupplyOrder n/Tim p/81234567 o/1 2
   ```

## **Q2: How do I view all customers/suppliers easily?**
**A:** We can use the filter command to view all customers/suppliers.
   ```
   filterContact t/Customer
   ```

## **Q3: How do I add collection dates and large quantities to orders?**
**A:** You can include collection dates and quantities in the order's remark field:
```
addCustomerOrder n/John p/91234567 o/1 2 r/Collection: 25/12/2024 6pm, Qty: 2x Croissant, 3x Muffin
```

Best practices for remarks:
- Start with collection date/time
- List quantities clearly
- Add any special instructions last
- Use consistent format for dates

## **Q4: Can I add multiple products with the same ID in one order?**
**A:** Yes, you can repeat Product IDs in your order if the customer wants multiple of the same item. For example:
```
addCustomerOrder n/John p/98765432 o/1 1 1
```
This would add three units of product ID 1 to the order.

## **Q5: How are orders sorted in the list?**
**A:** Orders are automatically sorted in this priority:
1. Pending orders (shown first)
- Sorted by date added (newest first)
2. Completed orders (shown after pending)
- Sorted by completion date (newest first)

This sorting helps you:
- Focus on pending orders that need attention
- Keep track of recent completions
- Maintain an organized workflow


## **Q6: How do I tag contacts with multiple tags?**
**A:** You can add multiple tags to contacts in several ways:
1. When creating a new contact:
   ```
   addContact n/John p/91234567 t/VIP t/Regular
   ```
2. When editing an existing contact:
   ```
   editContact 1 t/Wholesale t/Priority
   ```

Tags are useful for:
- Marking special status (e.g., t/VIP, t/Priority)
- Noting preferences (e.g., t/NutFree, t/Halal)

## **Q7: Are the commands case-sensitive?**
**A:** Yes, commands and parameter prefixes are case-sensitive, but parameter values are not. For example:
- ‚úÖ `addContact n/John p/12345678` (correct)
- ‚ùå `AddContact n/John p/12345678` (wrong - command must be lowercase)
- ‚ùå `addcontact N/John P/12345678` (wrong - prefixes must be lowercase)
- ‚úÖ `addContact n/JOHN p/12345678` (correct - name can be any case)

## **Q8: Why is my table not aligned properly in the UI?**
**A:** The table alignment may appear off if:
1. The window is too narrow - try widening your application window
2. There are very long entries - try using shorter entries or abbreviations

To ensure optimal viewing:
- Keep the window width as wide as possible
- Use reasonable length entries

## **Q9: Why are some UI elements hidden when I minimize the screen?**
**A:** BakeBuddy is optimized for a minimum window size of 800x600 pixels. When the window is smaller:
1. Some UI elements may be hidden to prevent overlap
2. Use the scroll bars to navigate hidden content
3. Resize the window larger to see all elements simultaneously

For the best experience:
- Keep the window at recommended size (1024x768 or larger)
- Use full screen mode for optimal viewing
- Avoid resizing to minimum dimensions

## **Q10: Are there limits to email and phone number length?**
**A:** There are several constraints to email and phone number.
- Phone numbers:
  - Minimum: 3 digits
  - Maximum: 15 digits
  - Must be unique in the contact list
- Email addresses:
  - Maximum: No limit. Not advisable to input long phone number as it may disrupt the UI display.
  - Must follow standard email format (xxx@xxx.xxx)
  - Special characters allowed: . _ - @
